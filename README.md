## Authentication

This application uses JWT-based authentication. There are two roles:

- **USER** ‚Äì can read/send messages in the public chat.
- **ADMIN** ‚Äì can register and delete other users and get statistics about users.
  
After logging in via `/auth/login`, the user receives a JWT token, which must be included in the `Authorization` header for secured endpoints.

## Default Admin User

For development/testing purposes, a default admin user is created on application startup **if none exists**:

- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`
> ‚ö†Ô∏è For development/testing only. Do not use these credentials in production.
